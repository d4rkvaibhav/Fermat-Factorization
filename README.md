## A Little Theory on Fermat Factorizaion
Fermat factorization can be used to factor a number which is a multiple of 2 close "prime number" i.e. n=p*q form.

The number gets factored down very efficiently within seconds if it is of the above form.

## ALGORITHM
Put t0=ceil(sqrt(n))

then find sqrt(pow((t0+1),2)-n),sqrt(pow((t0+2),2)-n),sqrt(pow((t0+3),2)-n),........

until the value of the sqrt will be a natural number.
